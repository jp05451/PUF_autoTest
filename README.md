# Select port
1. Connect your arduino mega to your computer
2. Open PIO home in VScode, and you can find the correct port from devices
3. Copy the port name
4. Replace the upload_port in platformio.ini with the correct port name

# Run
1. Press upload button after select the correct port
2. Open serial monitor
3. Now you can observe the result in the terminal
